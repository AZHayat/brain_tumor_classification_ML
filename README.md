# Brain Tumor Classification (MRI Scans) üß†

## Project Overview

This project is a deep learning model for classifying brain tumors using MRI scans. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to distinguish between different tumor types and healthy brain scans.

## Dataset üìä

### Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project is provided by Rajarshi Mandal on Kaggle. It contains 7,023 MRI brain scans categorized into four classes:

### Tumor Classes

Glioma Tumor: Tumors originating in the glial cells of the brain or spine. These are among the most common and aggressive types of brain tumors.

Meningioma Tumor: Develops in the meninges, the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Most are non-cancerous but can cause complications due to their size and location.

Pituitary Tumor: Forms in the pituitary gland, which regulates vital body functions. Although often benign, they can disrupt hormonal balance and cause significant health issues.

Healthy: MRI scans without evidence of tumors, serving as control samples for comparison and training AI models.

## Model Architecture üèóÔ∏è

### Model Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras. The model consists of:

### Layers

Convolutional Layers: Extract spatial features from MRI scans.

Pooling Layers: Reduce dimensionality while retaining important features.

Fully Connected Layers: Perform classification based on extracted features.

Softmax Activation: Outputs probabilities for each tumor class.

## Results üìà

### Model Performance

After training the CNN model on the dataset, the following results were observed:

Training Accuracy: Achieved high accuracy on the training set, indicating the model effectively learns patterns in MRI scans.

Validation Accuracy: The model generalizes well to unseen data, with consistent accuracy across validation sets.

Confusion Matrix Analysis: Most misclassifications occur between similar tumor types (e.g., Glioma vs. Meningioma), suggesting further tuning may be required.

### Future Improvements

Implementing data augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness.

Fine-tuning hyperparameters to further improve classification performance.

Exploring different CNN architectures for better feature extraction.
